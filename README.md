# Superhero fullstack app

The Fullstack Superhero Database App is a powerful web application that allows users to manage a vast collection of superheroes. With user authentication and authorization features, users can create an account, log in, and log out to access exclusive functionalities. Only logged-in users have the privilege to add new heroes and update the heroes they've created. Each hero has its own dedicated page, providing a more detailed description, including their nickname, real name, origin story, superpowers, and catchphrase. Users can easily edit any field of a hero, including uploading images to the database. Powered by Node.js and MongoDB on the backend, and React with Material-UI on the frontend, this fullstack app offers a secure and immersive experience for superhero enthusiasts to manage their superhero database.
